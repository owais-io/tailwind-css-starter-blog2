Owais is a person who never settles down in life for easy things. Success or failure, no matter the outcome, he always tries his luck with the things that push him outside of his comfort zone. He believes in the saying,

> _"Always aim for the moon, even if you miss, you will fall among stars."_

He completed his Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Karachi, Pakistan, and his Master of Arts in Economics from the same university. Owais has worked as an Accountant for 4.5 years and as an Income Tax Person in the Federal Government of Pakistan for more than 7 years.
