# Hey there! 👋

I'm Owais Abbasi, and I’m thrilled you stumbled upon my corner of the internet! Let me tell you a bit about myself.

I am 35, and I've spent most of my life in the bustling city of Karachi, Pakistan. My journey started in the world of Economics and Finance, where I earned my Master’s degree. But, like many of us, I found myself drawn to the ever-evolving world of tech. So, I decided to shake things up and dive into DevOps, Cloud Cyber Security, and all things AI.

Right now, I’m neck-deep in an Eduqual Level 6 Diploma in AIOps, where I'm picking up some pretty cool skills in DevOps, SysOps, and Cloud tech. Trust me, it’s a wild ride, and I’m loving every bit of it.

### My Tech Toolbox 🛠️

- **Linux Lover**: Yep, I’m all about that Red Hat Enterprise Linux life. File systems, permissions, and processes – you name it, I’m on it.
- **Docker Enthusiast**: From spinning up containers to managing Docker Swarm, I’ve got Docker down to a science.
- **Automation Buff**: Whether it's Bash scripting or Python automation, I’m always looking for ways to make life a bit easier (and code a bit smarter).
- **Cloud Curious**: I’m getting hands-on with cloud technologies, learning the ins and outs of AWS, and figuring out how to keep everything secure and running smoothly.

### What I’ve Been Up To

I’ve had my fair share of different gigs – from crunching numbers as an Accounts Executive to a Data Entry Operator at the Federal Board of Revenue. But my passion for tech took over, and now I’m a Remote Intern at Al-Nafi Cloud, diving deep into cloud projects and soaking up everything I can about DevOps and Cyber Security.

### Outside the Tech World 🌍

When I’m not glued to my laptop, I’m probably chilling with a good book, brushing up on my Arabic (work in progress!), or just enjoying some downtime. I’m fluent in English and Urdu, so feel free to reach out in either language – I’d love to chat!

### Let’s Connect!

I’m pretty active on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/owaisabbasi89). If you’re into tech, cloud, or just want to say hi, don’t be shy – drop me a message!

Thanks for stopping by, and stay tuned for more updates on my journey!
