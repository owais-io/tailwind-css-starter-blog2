# Mastering Secrets Management with Ansible Vault: A Detailed Guide with Use Cases

## Introduction to Ansible Vault

Ansible Vault is a powerful feature provided by Ansible to manage sensitive data securely. In infrastructure automation, particularly in environments involving DevOps, handling passwords, API keys, certificates, and other confidential data is crucial. Exposing such sensitive information can lead to severe security risks. This is where **Ansible Vault** becomes essential. It allows users to **encrypt, manage, and protect** sensitive data directly within Ansible playbooks, thus ensuring that no unprotected secrets are left lying around.

Ansible Vault supports encryption with the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** algorithm, which is a widely trusted method for secure data encryption.

### Why Use Ansible Vault?

- **Secure Storage:** Encrypt sensitive information like passwords, tokens, or API keys to keep it from being accidentally exposed.
- **Automated Decryption:** When running Ansible playbooks, the vault will automatically decrypt the data when the correct key is provided, simplifying the automation process.
- **Version Control:** Encrypted files can be safely committed to version control systems without risking the exposure of sensitive data.

## Key Features of Ansible Vault

1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt individual variables or entire files (like YAML files) with AES-256 encryption.
2. **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate encrypted data with playbooks, variables, and roles.
3. **Decryption**: Supports on-the-fly decryption while running playbooks.
4. **Multiple Vault IDs**: Enables usage of multiple vaults, each with its own key, for different environments or teams.

## Use Cases for Ansible Vault

### 1. **Storing API Keys and Passwords**

Imagine you're setting up a playbook to deploy applications in the cloud. You need to store API keys for AWS and database credentials to be used during deployment. Hardcoding these credentials into your playbook is risky, especially when the repository is shared with multiple developers or stored in a version control system like Git.

**Solution**: Use Ansible Vault to encrypt these keys and passwords. This ensures that only authorized users who have access to the vault password can decrypt and use the sensitive data.

#### Example:

```bash
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter a password. After that, you can input your sensitive data:

```yaml
aws_access_key: AKIA************
aws_secret_key: *************
db_password: SuperSecretPassword
```

Once encrypted, the file looks like this:

```yaml
$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
66323864393566616633323463396138643035366465613665356634313939396234396232316665
6532336338376436313761623865653835626266666661630a336332363961376133653439626365
```

To use it in your playbook, reference the encrypted variables like so:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Print AWS keys
      debug:
        msg: 'AWS Access Key is {{ aws_access_key }}'

    - name: Use DB password
      command: /usr/bin/mysql -u root -p{{ db_password }} -e "SHOW DATABASES"
```

Run the playbook using the vault:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

### 2. **Encrypting Entire Playbooks**

If your entire playbook contains sensitive information, you can encrypt the entire file, not just specific variables.

#### Example:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt playbook.yml
```

This command will encrypt the entire file. To later edit the playbook, you can use:

```bash
ansible-vault edit playbook.yml
```

### 3. **Managing Multiple Vault Files**

Ansible Vault allows you to create multiple vaults for different environments like development, staging, and production. You might have separate sets of secrets for each environment.

#### Example:

- Development vault: `dev_vault.yml`
- Production vault: `prod_vault.yml`

Each vault can have a different password. When running a playbook, you can specify which vault to use:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-id dev@prompt
ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-id prod@prompt
```

### 4. **Automating Decryption in CI/CD Pipelines**

In Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, secrets need to be handled securely. You can store the vault password in a secure location (e.g., in an environment variable) and automate decryption during playbook execution without manual intervention.

#### Example with Jenkins:

You could have an environment variable `VAULT_PASS` in Jenkins containing the vault password and pass it to Ansible:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-password-file /path/to/vault_password_file
```

## AES Encryption in Ansible Vault

Ansible Vault uses **AES-256**, which is an industry-standard symmetric encryption algorithm. Symmetric encryption means that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. AES-256 is known for its robustness and is widely trusted for securing sensitive data.

## Ansible Vault Commands Overview

To see all available commands and options for `ansible-vault`, you can use:

```bash
ansible-vault --help
```

### Common Commands:

- **Create**: Encrypt and create a new file.

  ```bash
  ansible-vault create secrets.yml
  ```

- **Encrypt**: Encrypt an existing file.

  ```bash
  ansible-vault encrypt playbook.yml
  ```

- **Decrypt**: Decrypt an encrypted file to plain text.

  ```bash
  ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml
  ```

- **Edit**: Open and edit an encrypted file.

  ```bash
  ansible-vault edit secrets.yml
  ```

- **Rekey**: Change the password for an encrypted file.
  ```bash
  ansible-vault rekey secrets.yml
  ```

## Best Practices with Ansible Vault

1. **Use Strong Vault Passwords**: Ensure that the passwords used for encrypting vaults are strong and stored securely.
2. **Avoid Hardcoding Vault Passwords**: Use external methods like environment variables or vault-password files to manage passwords.
3. **Automate Safely**: When integrating vaults into CI/CD pipelines, ensure that decryption is handled securely to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.
4. **Restrict Access**: Ensure only authorized users have access to vault files and the vault password.

## Conclusion

Ansible Vault is a must-have tool for securely managing sensitive data within Ansible workflows. By leveraging its encryption capabilities, you can ensure that your playbooks remain secure even when stored in shared environments. Through various commands and use cases, Vault makes it easy to integrate secrets management into your infrastructure automation, ensuring that your automation processes remain secure without introducing complexity.
