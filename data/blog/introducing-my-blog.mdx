# Welcome to My Blog

Welcome to my blog. This is my first post and an introductory post. In this blog I will be sharing the tutorials or explanations regarding the fields of **DevOps**, **SysOps**, **Cloud**, **Cyber Security**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.

## About Me

If I tell you about myself, my name is **Owais Abbasi**, and I have recently become a full-time **AI-driven Cloud Secure DevOps practitioner**. Prior to that, I was an accountant and a taxation official in a government department of Pakistan.

## Career and Education

So it also means that I am also looking for opportunities in the field of **DevOps** and **Cloud**, particularly **AWS**. At the same time, I am also pursuing an **Eduqual Level 6**, also called **RQF Level 6**, diploma in **Artificial Intelligence Operations**, which just not teaches you the field of **DevOps**, **Cyber Security**, **Cloud**, and **Artificial Intelligence**, but equips you with hands-on skills through their practical labs, helps you in job placement, and also provides three months of counseling in your first job. You can find the details [here](https://alnafi.com/?al_aid=6d5529727bec42a).

## Blog Vision

My future idea about this website or blog is that I will start sharing the blog posts with the very beginner concepts such as basic shell commands and **LINUX** operations and then gradually keep moving towards more and more advanced concepts. It is also possible that I may not follow a particular sequence of topics. Instead, I may change the topics to keep myself not bored and at the same time motivated and excited. So this does not confuse you, so you better look for the articles according to the tags.

## Get in Touch

In case you want to contact me, I can easily be found at **LinkedIn**. On LinkedIn, I am super active. Furthermore, I would also be sharing brief tutorial videos pertaining to every blog post. You can find my handles in the footer section.

So that is for now, and I might be sharing my heart out in the future posts, but that would be very rare because I want to stay focused towards sharing valuable **DevOps** content.

Thanks!
